# Automatic-SpeedTest
My internet speed was very fluctuating and unstable, I had to record them automatically and I had to examine them. When my research was unanswered, I decided to develop it myself and here is AutoSpeedTest.

# Description
a windows script to do automatic internet speed testing

# How it works
1. Download files
2. Run "speedtest.exe" and complete the first test. Close "speedtest.exe" (you only need to do this on the first installation.)
3. Run the script and write down how many minutes it will take to perform the operation, translating into seconds
4. Now you have a bot that records speed and ping values

# Screenshot
15m = 900s | 30m = 1800 | 1h = 3600s | slow connections may prefer these minutes
